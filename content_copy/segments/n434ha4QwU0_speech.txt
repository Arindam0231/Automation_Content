Ladies and Gentlemen,

I'm truly honored to be here with all of you today at Georgetown. Before we dive into our discussion, I want to take a moment to acknowledge a profound loss. Today, we lost an icon, Elijah Cummings. He was a powerful voice for equality, social progress, and unity. His legacy reminds us of the importance of standing together, especially in these critical times.

The future is in our hands, and whether you're a fan of Facebook or not, we need to recognize what's at stake. We're at a pivotal moment where we must come together to defend voice and free expression. The evolution of free speech in America is a testament to our resilience and commitment to progress. From the landmark case of *Schenck v. United States* in 1919 to the expansive rulings of the 1960s like *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*, our legal protections have broadened dramatically. This has allowed movements like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo to gain traction and spread virally on platforms like Facebook.

Just a century ago, many of the stories and experiences people share today would have been illegal or silenced. The internet has amplified our voices, reaching billions of people. But we're at another crossroads. As we face economic transitions, social polarization, and global migration, there's a growing impulse to restrict free expression. We must resist this urge and continue to stand for free expression, understanding that progress often comes through challenging conversations.

Free expression isn't absolute, and it's crucial to balance it with the rights and protections of others. At Facebook, our values are inspired by the American tradition of free speech, but we also recognize the complexities and unintended consequences of speech restrictions. We must ensure that our efforts empower people and don't reinforce existing power structures.

We face three major threats to free expression: legal restrictions, global internet fragmentation, and the rise of platforms with differing values. Countries are imposing their speech restrictions on the world, and we're seeing a shift in the global internet landscape. While American platforms once dominated, Chinese companies are now major players, and their values differ significantly. We must fight for a global internet that respects free expression.

Tolerance and progress come from open dialogue and shared experiences. Our founding fathers considered free expression essential, like air we don't miss until it's gone. But I'm optimistic. People understand the value of their voice and believe in each other. If our governments, platforms, and communities commit to open dialogue and making space for more perspectives, we'll make progress.

It won't be linear, and there will be setbacks. But if we can't agree to let each other talk about the issues, we can't even take the first step. So, let's build a shared understanding, even when it's hard. That's how we move forward and create a society where everyone feels included and heard.

Thank you, and let's continue this important conversation.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I want to take a moment to share a personal story with you, one that shaped my beliefs and inspired me to pursue the work I do today. It all started back when I was in college, during a time when our country was at war in Iraq. The atmosphere on our campus was one of disbelief and uncertainty. Many of us felt that the decision to go to war had been made without hearing a multitude of important perspectives. The impact on our soldiers, their families, and our collective national psyche was profound and severe.

Most of us felt helpless, as if we had no power to influence the course of events. But I remember thinking, "What if more people had a voice to share their experiences? What if we could hear from those who were directly affected, from those who had a different perspective? Maybe things could have turned out differently."

Those early years in college instilled in me a deep belief: giving more people a voice empowers the powerless and drives society to improve over time. It's a belief that has guided me throughout my career and continues to inspire me today.

You see, when we listen to each other, when we hear the stories and experiences of those around us, we gain a deeper understanding of the world. We become more empathetic, more compassionate, and more willing to work together to create positive change.

So, let's continue to amplify the voices of those who are often left unheard. Let's give power to the powerless and strive to make our society a better, more inclusive place for all. Because, at the end of the day, our voices, when united, can create a symphony of change that resonates far and wide.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I want to take you back to the early days of Facebook. Back then, it was just a humble project I was working on, a simple platform designed for my community. This was a time when I was able to witness firsthand how my values and beliefs could take shape, even on a smaller scale.

What I saw was truly inspiring. Students started to express themselves, to share who they were and what mattered to them. This led to the formation of more student groups, the organization of various businesses, and even challenges to some of the established norms around campus.

This experience taught me a profound lesson. Often, we focus on the big events and institutions, believing they are the driving forces behind progress. But in reality, it's the individuals who have more of a voice who truly make the difference. It's their ideas, their passions, and their actions that lead to the bigger stories and the real progress in our lives.

So, let's not forget the power of giving individuals a voice. Because when we do, we open the door to endless possibilities and true change. Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I want to take a moment to share with you something that has been at the core of my work and passion for quite some time now. It's all about giving people a voice and bringing them together. These two ideas, voice and inclusion, are not just simple concepts; they are the pillars that support a more connected and understanding world.

You know, throughout history, we've seen time and time again that when more people have the chance to share their experiences and perspectives, we move closer to creating a truly inclusive society. It's not always easy to see, especially in today's complex world, but it's there. It's in the stories we tell, the conversations we have, and the connections we make.

Our commitment to each other is what makes this possible. It's about valuing each other's right to express ourselves and be heard, even when we might not always agree. It's about putting aside our personal desires to always get our way and instead focusing on how we can make progress together.

So, let's continue to amplify voices, to listen, to learn, and to grow. Because when we do, we're not just building services or communities; we're building a future where everyone has a seat at the table and a chance to be heard. And that, my friends, is something truly powerful.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I want to take a moment to discuss something that's been weighing heavily on my mind lately. You know, we often talk about the power of giving everyone a voice, how it brings us together, and makes us stronger as a community. But there's a growing sentiment out there that's challenging this very idea. Some people now believe that this surge in voices is actually driving us apart, creating divisions rather than unity.

Now, I understand where they're coming from. In a world where we're all fighting for our causes, it's easy to think that achieving our political goals is more important than ensuring every person has a voice. But let me tell you, I find this perspective dangerous. It's like saying that some voices matter more than others, and that's just not how we should be thinking.

Today, I want to delve into why this is a concern and explore some of the crucial choices we face when it comes to free expression. We're at a crossroads, and the path we choose will shape our future. So, let's engage in this conversation openly, respectfully, and with a shared goal of understanding. Because at the end of the day, our voices, all of them, are what make us human. And that's something worth fighting for.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to take you on a journey through time, a journey that highlights the power and importance of free expression. Throughout history, the ability to use our voices has been a unifying force, bringing people together in ways that nothing else can. Let's start with the civil rights movement in the United States. Frederick Douglass, a former slave and a prominent abolitionist, once described free expression as the "great moral renovator of our society." He knew that slavery couldn't coexist with free speech, and civil rights leaders echoed this sentiment, time and again arguing that their protests were a protected form of expression. Many of the cases involving the civil rights movement were decided on First Amendment grounds, underscoring the critical role of free speech in the fight for equality.

But this isn't just an American story. We see the same pattern globally. The ability to speak freely has been central to the fight for democracy worldwide. Repressive societies have always been the ones to restrict speech the most. And when people finally get the chance to speak, they often use their voices to call for change. Just this year, we've seen people use their voices to end multiple long-running dictatorships in Northern Africa. We're already starting to hear from people whose voices had been excluded simply because they were women or because they believed in democracy.

Let's rewind a bit further. Back when America was deeply polarized about its role in World War I, the Supreme Court made a decision that seems astonishing today. They ruled that socialist leader Eugene Debs could be imprisoned for making an anti-war speech. It's hard to believe now, but at the time, many in society wanted to suppress this kind of expression. They thought it was a threat, even though, in the end, pulling back on free expression only hurt the very minority views they sought to protect.

From where we stand today, it seems obvious that protests for civil rights or making a speech against a war should be allowed. But we must remember that this wasn't always the case. The desire to suppress expression was deeply ingrained in society at the time. It's a reminder that our journey towards understanding and appreciating the power of free speech is ongoing.

So, let's celebrate the power of our voices. Let's remember that when we speak up, we're not just expressing ourselves, we're also bringing people together, fighting for what's right, and making our societies stronger. Because, as history has shown us time and time again, free expression is not just a right, it's a force for good. Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to take a moment to talk about something that's incredibly close to our hearts as Americans - free expression. You know, when we think about free expression, it's easy to get caught up in the big, historical moments, like the Enlightenment and the drafting of our Constitution. We all know that the First Amendment was a game-changer, right? It gave us the freedom to speak our minds, to gather peacefully, and to worship as we choose.

But let me tell you, our understanding of free expression has evolved so much even in just the last hundred years. It's not just about speeches in town squares or petitions to the government anymore. No, it's become so much broader, so much more inclusive.

Now, free expression is about the artist who paints a controversial piece, the writer who challenges societal norms, the activist who uses social media to rally support for a cause. It's about the student who asks tough questions in class, the scientist who dares to explore uncharted territories, and the comedian who pushes the boundaries of humor.

It's about all of us, every day, expressing ourselves in ways that might make some people uncomfortable, but that's the beauty of it. Because at the heart of free expression is the belief that every voice matters, every perspective is valuable, and every story deserves to be told.

So, let's celebrate this evolution, this expansion of free expression. Let's embrace the diversity of voices and ideas that make our society rich and vibrant. Because at the end of the day, it's our shared commitment to free expression that makes us truly American.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to take you on a journey through time to explore the fascinating evolution of free speech in our country. It's a story that begins in the early 20th century and continues to shape our society today.

In 1919, we had our first significant Supreme Court case that delved into the intricacies of the First Amendment. This was the case of *Shank versus the United States*. Back then, the First Amendment only applied to the federal government, leaving the states free to impose their own restrictions on our right to speak. Imagine a time when expressing your opinions could land you in trouble, and the government could silence you with ease.

But our ability to call out what we believed was wrong was even more restricted. Libel laws were stringent, and if you said something negative about someone, even if it was true, you could face serious consequences. The legal standard shifted to require proof of truth, but even that wasn't enough to ensure free expression.

It wasn't until the 1960s that we saw a significant shift in our free speech protections. The Supreme Court handed down landmark decisions like *New York Times versus Sullivan*. This ruling established that you could criticize public figures without fear of legal repercussions, as long as you weren't acting with actual malice, even if what you were saying turned out to be false.

This evolution in our understanding and application of free speech has been a journey of expanding horizons. It has allowed us to voice our opinions, challenge the status quo, and hold our leaders accountable. It has been a journey that has shaped our democracy and continues to do so today.

So, the next time you exercise your right to free speech, remember the path that led us here. Remember the battles fought and the victories won to ensure that we can speak our minds without fear. It's a right that we should cherish and protect, for it is the cornerstone of our freedom.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to talk about something that's become an integral part of our lives - social media. It's not just a platform for sharing cat videos or selfies; it's a powerful tool that's changing the world around us.

Take, for instance, the Black Lives Matter movement. It started as a hashtag on Facebook, and look where it is now - a global movement that's sparking important conversations and driving change. The MeToo movement, too, gained immense traction on social media, giving voice to countless individuals who had been silenced for far too long.

You know, just a century ago, many of the stories we're sharing today would have been illegal to write down. Without the internet, they certainly wouldn't have reached so many people. But today, with Facebook alone, over two billion people have a platform to express themselves, to share their experiences, and to help others.

Social media has democratized information and given power to the people. It's a space where anyone can start a conversation, challenge the status quo, and inspire others to action. It's not just about likes and shares; it's about voices being heard, stories being told, and change being made.

So, let's embrace this power. Let's use social media to connect, to inspire, and to make a difference. Because, as we've seen, it's a tool that can truly change the world. Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I want to take a moment to talk about something that's close to my heart and, I believe, to yours as well. While we often get swept up in the grand social movements and large-scale initiatives, let's not forget that true progress often starts with the small, everyday actions of individuals and communities.

You know, it's the Air Force moms who, when they can't have their children home for the holidays, take it upon themselves to start a Facebook group. This isn't just a digital gathering; it's a virtual home away from home for their children and other service members. It's a place where they can find support, share stories, and feel a little less alone.

It's the church group that, in the aftermath of a hurricane, doesn't just pray for those affected but rolls up their sleeves and gets to work. They provide food, offer a warm meal and a listening ear, and volunteer their time to help rebuild what was lost. They turn tragedy into a chance to come together and show the power of community.

And let's not forget the small business on the corner. Once, they might have felt left behind, lacking the sophisticated tools that only the big guys had access to. But now, with technology more accessible than ever, they can level the playing field. They can get their voice out there, reach more customers, create jobs in their town, and become a social hub in their community.

These are the stories that inspire me, the stories of people making a difference, one step at a time. It's not always about the big, sweeping changes. Sometimes, it's about the small acts of kindness, the community efforts, and the individual courage that make all the difference.

So, let's celebrate these moments. Let's support these individuals and communities. Because, at the end of the day, it's these actions that shape our world, one person, one community at a time.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I want to take a moment to talk about something truly transformative that's happening right before our eyes. It's a story that's playing out in countless ways, all around the globe. It's about people finding their voice, about progress, and about the incredible power of human connection.

You see, when we talk about decentralization of power, we're not just talking about a political theory or a business model. We're talking about billions of individual stories, each one a testament to the power of expression. This isn't just about people speaking up; it's about people being heard at a scale never before possible.

Think about it. Just a few decades ago, if you wanted your voice to reach beyond your immediate circle, you had to go through gatekeepers—politicians, media moguls, or other established figures. But today, that's changed. Thanks to technology, we've entered a new era, what some call the "fifth estate." It's a world where the power to influence and inform doesn't reside in a few hands, but in the hands of billions.

Now, I understand the concerns that people have about how tech platforms have centralized power. It's a valid point. But let's not overlook the bigger picture. These same platforms have done something extraordinary: they've put power directly into people's hands. They've democratized communication, giving everyone a chance to share their stories, their ideas, their passions.

This isn't just a technological shift; it's a cultural and legal one too. Throughout history, we've seen how laws and cultural norms have evolved to protect and promote free expression. Now, technology is taking that evolution to a whole new level. It's an amazing expansion of voice, a global conversation that's happening in real-time.

So, let's celebrate this decentralization of power. Let's embrace the fact that people no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers to make their voices heard. Because when billions of voices come together, that's when we see true progress and social cohesion. That's when we see the world change for the better.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to talk about something that's incredibly important, yet often complex and challenging: the delicate balance between free expression and social tension. You see, giving people a voice and fostering broader inclusion are two sides of the same coin. Over time, we've seen a clear trend towards giving more people a voice, and that's a good thing. It's empowering, it's democratic, and it's essential for progress.

But here's the catch. When social tensions rise, our natural instinct is often to clamp down on free expression. We want the progress that comes from open dialogue and diverse perspectives, but we don't want the discomfort or conflict that can come with it. It's like we want the cake, but we don't want to deal with the floury mess in the kitchen.

Let's look at some historical examples. During the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King, Jr. was unconstitutionally jailed for peacefully protesting. While he was in that Birmingham jail, he wrote a letter that's now famous. He argued that the only way to address the injustices of society is through open dialogue and peaceful protest. Yet, even then, there were those who wanted to silence him, to shut down the tension his voice created.

Fast forward to the Vietnam War era, and we saw a similar trend on college campuses. Students were protesting, and some people wanted to silence them, to stop the tension their voices brought. And if we go even further back, during World War I, America was deeply divided about its role in the war. The Supreme Court at the time ruled that you couldn't criticize the government's war efforts. They wanted to silence dissenting voices to avoid social tension.

So, what's the balance here? How do we navigate this complex landscape? It's not easy, and there are no simple answers. But I believe it starts with understanding that free expression is not just a right, but a responsibility. It's about listening as much as it's about speaking. It's about respecting different perspectives, even when they make us uncomfortable.

Because at the end of the day, that's how we grow. That's how we learn. That's how we move forward. Not by silencing each other, but by engaging, by debating, by listening, and by understanding. That's how we turn social tension into social progress.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We're living in a time of significant social tension, aren't we? The world is changing rapidly, and it's not always easy to keep up. We're dealing with massive economic shifts due to globalization and technology, still feeling the ripple effects of the 2008 financial crisis, and grappling with deeply polarized views on social issues. Add to that the increased migration we're seeing not just here, but across the EU and around the world, and it's no wonder our societies are feeling the strain.

Now, in times like these, it's tempting to want to pull back, to retreat into what feels safe and familiar. And one of the first things that often gets pushed aside is free expression. It's messy, it can be uncomfortable, and it can sometimes feel like it's causing more harm than good.

But let me ask you something: How do we move forward if we can't confront the ideas that challenge us? How do we make progress if we can't discuss, debate, and even disagree with each other? The truth is, the journey towards greater progress is a long and winding one. And it requires us to engage with ideas that might make us uncomfortable, to listen to voices that might not sound like our own.

That's why I'm here today. I believe that we must continue to stand for free expression. It's not always easy, and it's not always pretty. But it's essential. Because it's through free expression that we can challenge the status quo, push for change, and ultimately, make our societies better.

So, let's not shy away from the messiness of free expression. Let's embrace it, because it's the key to a more open, more inclusive, and more progressive future. Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to touch on a topic that's close to our hearts and crucial to our society: the limitations of free expression. Now, I understand that this might seem like a heavy subject, but bear with me. We all know that free expression is a fundamental right, and it's something we at Facebook deeply value. In fact, our values are inspired by the American tradition, which is more supportive of free expression than anywhere else in the world.

But let's not forget, free expression has never been absolute. Some people argue that internet platforms should allow all expression that's protected under the First Amendment. However, it's important to remember that the First Amendment explicitly doesn't apply to companies. Now, don't get me wrong, we're all about free speech, but we also need to acknowledge that some speech can infringe on other people's rights.

You see, rules about what you can and can't say often have unintended consequences. Let's take the UK, for example. When speech restrictions were implemented in the last century, parliament noted that they were often applied more heavily to citizens from poorer backgrounds. Why? Because the way they expressed things didn't match the elite Oxbridge style. This is a stark reminder that in everything we do, we need to make sure that we're empowering people and not simply reinforcing existing institutions and power structures.

So, how do we strike this balance? How do we ensure that we're fostering an environment where people can freely express themselves, while also protecting the rights of others? It's a complex question, and there's no easy answer. But it's a conversation we need to have, and it's a challenge we need to face head-on.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to continuing this important dialogue with you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, we stand at a critical juncture, a crossroads where our collective future hinges on the choices we make. The question before us is simple yet profound: Are we going to continue our relentless fight to amplify more voices, to ensure that every person has the right to be heard? Or are we going to retreat from the principles of free expression that have long been the bedrock of our societies?

We face three significant threats on this path forward. The first is legal. Around the world, we're witnessing an alarming trend: laws and regulations that chip away at our fundamental human rights, particularly our right to free expression. These local laws are troubling enough when they silence speech in countries where democracy and a free press are already under siege. But it's even more concerning when these countries attempt to export their restrictive speech policies to the rest of the world.

This brings us to a larger question about the future of our global internet. For decades, the internet outside of China has been largely defined by American platforms that champion free expression. But there's no certainty that these values will prevail. Just a decade ago, nearly all major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top ten are Chinese. This shift is evident even in social media. While platforms like WhatsApp, with their strong encryption and privacy protections, are used by protesters and activists worldwide, Chinese apps like TikTok are growing rapidly globally. Yet, on TikTok, mentions of these very protests are censored, even here in the United States.

Is this the future we want? A future where different standards of free expression exist, where some voices are amplified while others are silenced? We must ask ourselves: What kind of world do we want to live in? One where the free exchange of ideas is encouraged and protected, or one where speech is restricted and controlled?

We have the power to shape this future. We can choose to stand up for free expression, to fight for the rights of every individual to be heard. But we must act now, before it's too late. Our voices matter, and together, we can ensure that the principles of free expression continue to thrive, both at home and around the world.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to delve into a topic that's not just timely, but also deeply significant. We're talking about free expression, and the values that shape it. Now, you might be thinking, "Why is this important? We're here to discuss the issues of the day, right?" Absolutely, but let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture.

You see, the question of which nation's values will dictate what speeches are allowed in the future is a powerful one. It puts into sharp focus our ongoing debates about free expression. Now, I know we don't all agree on where to draw the line on specific issues. That's the beauty of free expression - it allows us to disagree, to challenge each other, and to grow. But even in our disagreements, we're united by a common set of values. We're having this conversation because we believe in the power of voice and expression.

Imagine, for a moment, if another nation's platform set the rules. Our discourse could be defined by a completely different set of values. That's a future I don't want to live in. So, as our policymakers work to define internet policy and regulation, addressing public safety and important social issues, I urge them to be proactive. Let's write policies that not only protect our values here at home but also help them triumph around the world.

Free expression is not just a right, it's a responsibility. It's a responsibility to listen, to challenge, and to learn. It's a responsibility to push back against those who would silence us. So, let's stand together, let's speak up, and let's make sure that the values of voice and expression continue to resonate, not just today, but for decades to come.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to talk about a critical aspect of our digital world – the challenges we face when it comes to expression on our platforms. Now, I know this is a topic that's close to many of your hearts, and it's something I'm deeply committed to. But let's face it, we're not perfect. We make decisions every day that can impact people's ability to speak freely and share their ideas.

You might be wondering, "How much control do these platforms really have?" And you're right to ask. We have a significant role in shaping the conversations that happen on our services. But here's the thing: we shouldn't be making all these important decisions about speech on our own. We need a more democratic process, clearer rules for the internet, and perhaps even some new institutions to help guide us.

That's why we're taking a big step forward. We're establishing an independent oversight board. This board will have the power to make final, binding decisions about whether content stays up or comes down across our services. And let me be clear, these decisions will be out of our hands – even mine. We're going to appoint members with diverse views and backgrounds, but all of them will hold free expression as a paramount value.

Why is this so important to me? Because I'm not always going to be here. I want to ensure that these values of voice and free expression are deeply ingrained in how this company is governed, long after I'm gone.

We're not claiming to have all the answers, but we're committed to finding a better way. A way that respects free expression, addresses concerns about bias, and gives people a say in how their ideas are treated. Because at the end of the day, it's not just about us – it's about all of us, and the conversations we want to have in this digital world.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to talk about a challenge that's particularly close to home and yet, incredibly complex. It's a challenge that doesn't come from outside forces, but from within our own culture. We're living in a time of great tension, not just here, but around the world. And in this climate, we're seeing an impulse to restrict speech and impose new norms on what we can and can't say.

Now, I'm not here to debate the merits of specific viewpoints or the intentions behind these restrictions. What I want to discuss is the broader impact of this trend. We're seeing people across the political spectrum trying to define certain speeches as dangerous, because they might lead to political outcomes that are deemed unacceptable.

Some people argue that, given the high stakes, we can't trust our fellow citizens with the power to communicate freely and decide what to believe. But let me tell you, I firmly believe that this is more dangerous for democracy in the long run than almost any speech.

Democracy thrives on the idea that we value each other's right to express ourselves and be heard, even when we don't always agree with the outcomes. We can't impose tolerance from the top down. It has to come from within. It comes from people opening up, sharing their experiences, and together, weave a shared story for our society. A story that makes us all feel like we're a part of something greater.

So, let's not shy away from difficult conversations. Let's not silence voices because they're uncomfortable or because they might lead to outcomes we don't like. Instead, let's engage, let's listen, and let's build a society where everyone feels heard and valued. Because that's how we strengthen our democracy, one conversation at a time.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I want to share something with you today that's close to my heart. It's about the importance of free expression, something our founding fathers valued so deeply that they likened it to air. You know, you don't miss it until it's gone. But why is that? Why is free expression so crucial?

Well, imagine if we couldn't express our thoughts, our opinions, our dreams. Imagine if we were silenced, our voices stifled. It's a chilling thought, isn't it? Because when people can't express themselves, they start to lose faith in the very system that's supposed to protect them. They become disillusioned, disheartened. And that's when we see a rise in populist parties, those that promise specific policy outcomes, but at the cost of our democratic and civic norms.

But I'm not here to paint a gloomy picture. I'm actually quite optimistic. I believe that people understand the value of free expression. They appreciate the voice they have now, the ability to speak their minds, to challenge ideas, to dream big. Because, at the end of the day, I think most of us believe in each other. We believe in the power of our collective voice, in the strength of our shared humanity.

Free expression isn't just a right, it's a responsibility. It's a responsibility to listen, to learn, to grow. It's a responsibility to challenge, to question, to push boundaries. Because that's how we move forward. That's how we make our democracy stronger.

So, let's cherish our freedom of expression. Let's use it, respect it, and protect it. Because it's not just about us, it's about everyone. It's about our future, our children's future. It's about the kind of society we want to live in.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I want to take a moment to talk about something that's incredibly important to all of us—our collective future. We're living in a time where communication and expression have never been more vital. But with great power comes great responsibility, and that's where our governments and digital platforms come into play.

Imagine a world where our governments truly respect our right to express ourselves freely. A world where we can share our thoughts, our dreams, and our concerns without fear of reprisal. This isn't just a nice idea; it's a fundamental right that we all deserve. When our governments uphold this right, they're not just protecting our voices, they're fostering an environment where diverse ideas can flourish.

Now, let's talk about our digital platforms. They've become the town squares of our time, where conversations happen, and connections are made. But with this power comes a responsibility to ensure that these spaces are safe and respectful. We need our platforms to be vigilant in preventing harm, whether it's through misinformation, hate speech, or any form of digital abuse. When they live up to this responsibility, they're not just platforms; they're guardians of our digital well-being.

But it's not just about governments and platforms. Each one of us has a role to play. We need to commit to being open-minded and inclusive. We need to make space for more perspectives, even if they challenge our own beliefs. Because when we do that, we're not just tolerating differences; we're celebrating them. We're enriching our collective understanding and paving the way for true progress.

So, let's come together. Let's demand that our governments respect our right to express ourselves. Let's hold our platforms accountable for creating safe spaces. And let's, each and every one of us, commit to being open and inclusive. Because when we do, I truly believe we'll make progress. We'll create a world where every voice is heard, every perspective is valued, and every person feels seen and respected.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to take a moment to reflect on our journey as a nation, a journey that's been marked by both triumph and trial. We've seen deep polarization in the aftermath of World War I, and we've weathered intense political violence during the 1960s. These challenges have shaped us, but they've also shown us something profound: progress isn't always a straight path.

You see, sometimes we take two steps forward, only to find ourselves taking one step back. It's a dance, a back and forth, a constant negotiation. But here's the thing - if we can't even agree to let each other talk about the issues, then we're stuck. We can't even take that first step forward.

It's not easy, I know. It's hard to listen when we're so sure we're right. It's tough to find common ground when we're so divided. But this is how we build a shared understanding. This is how we move forward, together.

So, let's talk. Let's listen. Let's learn from each other. Because at the end of the day, we're not just trying to take steps forward, we're trying to build a future. And that future is brighter when we walk together, hand in hand, side by side.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I stand before you today to talk about something that's truly remarkable and, in many ways, revolutionary. We're living in a time where more people from diverse backgrounds are finding their voice and being heard. This is not just a trend; it's a testament to our collective progress and a beacon of hope for a more inclusive future.

You see, we're witnessing a beautiful tapestry of stories and experiences being woven into the fabric of our society. People from different walks of life—different cultures, races, genders, and socio-economic backgrounds—are sharing their perspectives, their dreams, and their challenges. This diversity of voices is enriching our collective narrative, making it more vibrant, more nuanced, and more true to life.

But let's not forget, this isn't something that happens overnight. It takes time, patience, and a genuine effort to listen. We're not just talking about hearing words; we're talking about understanding, empathizing, and valuing each other's experiences. It's like trying to knit a complex, intricate pattern. You can't rush it. You have to take your time, carefully following the design, to create something truly beautiful.

So, let's embrace this journey. Let's celebrate each voice that finds its way into the conversation. Let's make an effort to listen, to learn, and to grow together. Because when we do, we're not just creating a more inclusive society; we're creating a better world for all of us.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I want to take a moment to talk about something that's incredibly important to all of us - the power of individual voices. Now, I know Facebook isn't everyone's cup of tea, but let's set that aside for a moment. What's truly at stake here is something much bigger - it's about our collective future and the importance of voice and free expression.

You see, I firmly believe in giving people a voice. Why? Because, at the end of the day, I believe in people. I believe that each one of us has the power to make a difference, to shape our world, and to bring us closer together. And that's what we need to stand for, especially at this critical moment in time.

Imagine a world where every individual's voice is heard, where every perspective is valued, and where every story is told. That's the world I envision, and I believe it's within our reach. But it won't happen on its own. We have to fight for it, together.

When we come together, when we listen to each other, when we embrace our differences and learn from them, that's when the magic happens. That's when we can work through our challenges, overcome our obstacles, and write a new chapter in our history. A chapter where our individual voices and perspectives bring us closer, rather than driving us apart.

So, let's stand for voice and free expression. Let's believe in people and in the power of our collective voices. Because together, I truly believe that we can shape a future that's brighter, more inclusive, and more united than we ever thought possible.

Thank you.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

As we come to the close of our time together today, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude. Thank you for being here, for your attention, and for the energy you've brought to this gathering.

We stand here today, not just as individuals, but as a community, united by a common purpose and a shared vision. And as we look around, we see the fruits of our collective efforts. We see the people who have dedicated their time, their talents, and their hearts to making this possible. To them, we say a profound thank you. We honor their commitment, their passion, and their unwavering dedication.

In this moment, let's take a step back and appreciate the journey that has led us here. It hasn't been easy, but it has been rewarding. We've faced challenges, yes, but we've also celebrated victories. And through it all, we've been blessed. We've been blessed with the opportunity to make a difference, to touch lives, and to create something truly special.

As we move forward, let's carry this spirit with us. Let's continue to support one another, to lift each other up, and to dream big. Because together, there's no limit to what we can achieve.

In the words of the great philosopher, Henry Ford, "Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success." So, let's keep coming together, keep moving forward, and let's make our success even greater.

Thank you once again for your presence, your support, and your dedication. Here's to the future, and here's to the incredible things we'll accomplish together.

God bless you all.
